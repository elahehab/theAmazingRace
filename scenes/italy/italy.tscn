This monument is widely known to be a major historical landmark for Italians, as it was once the ultimate place of bloodsport and glory. Only the true fighters lasted and were rewarded.

Your mission is simple:
1. Your team will once again chose colours that represents each member.
2. You will be shown Battle Poses challenging each otehr. When the colour is shown, the member tied to that colour has to quickly engage in that battle pose.
3. A \"battle\" is done once both members enact the poses."
